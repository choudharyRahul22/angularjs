<h3>Search Results</h3>
<div class="list-group" >
  
    <!-- controller for this page is mainController which has person object
     so person object by default will be availabe to : <search-result> directive 

    So here child <search-result> scope can access parent scope (mainController) , which can be dangerous like 
    if child changes anything that will affect the parent also.

    We added scope to directive which will isolate the direvtive to access the parent scope
    To access the parent scope we added custom attribute to directive which recive its value from parent scope
    Than we use this custom attribute inside scope, which acts as a model for direvtive and we access it inside template

    We are passing the object directly to directive custom attribute

    <search-result person-object="person" person-object-function="personObjectFunction(aperson)" ng-repeat="person in persons">
        *search result may not be valid!
    </search-result>
